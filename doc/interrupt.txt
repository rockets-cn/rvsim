Detailed RISC-V Interrupt Handling

* M mode only

interrupt types:
	* M: external, timer, software
	* exceptions: caused by instruction execution

States:
* CSRs
	* mstatus: mpp, mie , mpie
		mpp:  machine previous privilege mode
		mie: machine interrupt enable
		mpie: machine previous interrupt enable
		* set when entering and exiting interrupt handlers
		* can set mie to enable or disable interrupts
	* mip: msip , meip, mtip
		* set by CPU upon receipt of signal from CLINT or PLIC?
		* read by CPU when checking to see if there is interrupt to be handled
		* can be cleared by source
	* mie: msie , meie , mtie
		* written by OS to enable/disable individual interrupts, overall control is at mstatus.mie
		* used by CPU to decide whether to handle the corresponding type of interrupt?
	* mcause
		* set by CPU when handlingan interrupt
		* used in interrupt hanlder?
	* mepc
		* set by CPU when handling an interrupt
		* used by mret to return to the next instruction
	* mtvec: interrupt handler address (could be vectored)
		* set by OS
		* used by CPU to handle interrupt
	* mtval
		* set by CPU when there is an interrupt
		* can be used by interrupt handler
* memory-mapped I/O registers
	* mtime (64bit)
		* time, updated by CLINT according to external clock
	* mtimecmp (64bit)
		* user settable
		* will raise timer interrupt if mtime >= mtimecmp; CLINT will send signal to CPU, which updates mtip
		* set a bigger mtimecmp to clear the interrupt
	* msip
		* software write to set/clear
		* CLINT uses it to generate software interrupt signal to CPU, CPU sets msip accordingly
* internal state?
	* mode
		* changed when handling and returning from interrupt (actually currently we only support M mode, but we still go through the motions)


CPU per-cycle processing:
* caused by instruction: ebreak/ecall, illegal instructionse etc.
* timer
* software interrupt
* external interrupt

after executing each instruction, check to see if there is an interrupt to be handled (no software/external interrupt yet)
	if (mtip&&mtie&&mie || exception)
		mstatus.mpp = mode ; mstatus.mpie = mstatus.mie ; mstatus.mie = 0 ;
		mepc = PC
		set mcause, mtval
		mode = M 

mret instruction:
* set mode to mstatus.mpp
* mstatus: mie = mpie ; mpie=1 ; mpp = m (should be u when we support u mode)
* jump to mepc
